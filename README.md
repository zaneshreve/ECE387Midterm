# ECE387Midterm
Midterm Project for Embedded Systems Design

This repository contains the Arduino source code for my nRF24L01+ (RF24) Remote Control Car project. There are 2 Arduino .ino files, because two microcontrollers are require for this project. The RemoteCode.ino file should be uploaded to the microcontroller that will be transmitting using an RF24 module, and the CarCode.ino file should be uploaded to the microcontroller that will be receiving via RF24 and actuating the car's motors. 

The [wiki](https://github.com/zaneshreve/ECE387Midterm/wiki) for this repository contains useful information including a project overview, more details about the components used (specifically the RF24 module), info about the code and its development, diagrams showing the wiring and assembly of components for this project, and a description of the evolution of this project.
